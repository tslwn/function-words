A basic investigation with two aims:

- To determine whether semantic content, as defined by [Herbelot and Ganesalingham (2013)](https://aclanthology.org/P13-2078/), can be used to differentiate between function words and content words.
- To determine whether function words can be identified by the distributions of semantic content among examples of compositional and non-compositional communication protocols, after [Korbek et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15058).
